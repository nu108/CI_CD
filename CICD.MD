CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment), and it's a set of practices and tools used in software development to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software.


Continuous Integration is the practice of regularly merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. These code changes are automatically built, tested, and verified to ensure they don't introduce errors or conflicts.

Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI, where code changes that pass automated tests are automatically prepared and made ready for deployment to a production environment.

Faster Development: CI/CD helps in speeding up the software development process by automating repetitive tasks like building, testing, and deployment. This reduces the time required to release new features or bug fixes.

Better Quality: Regular automated testing ensures that issues are caught early, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs or regressions into the codebase.

Consistency: CI/CD pipelines provide a consistent and repeatable process for building, testing, and deploying software, reducing human error and variability in the release process.

Collaboration: CI encourages collaboration among development teams by integrating their code changes frequently, making it easier to identify and resolve conflicts.

Risk Reduction: CD, especially Continuous Deployment, minimizes the risk associated with manual deployments and ensures that the latest code changes are always ready for production.

Scalability: CI/CD is highly adaptable and works well in a variety of development environments, from small startups to large enterprises.
